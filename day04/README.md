## Ex00
The candy vending machine server follows the Swagger specification to handle 
candy purchases. The server validates user input, calculates change, and 
responds accordingly.

Run in two different terminal sessions  
`make run_ex00`  
`make test_ex00`

### Note
The candy server was generated using Swagger 2.0 with the following steps:  

1. Go-swagger installing  
   `brew tap go-swagger/go-swagger`  
   `brew install go-swagger`

2. Generate an API server, using the following spec: **./api/swagger.yml**  
   `swagger generate server -f ./api/swagger.yml  -A candies`

## Ex01
Implemented certificate authentication for the server and a test client capable of 
querying the API using a self-signed certificate. The server supports secure URLs, 
and mutual TLS authentication is enforced.

Run in two different terminal sessions  
`make run_ex01`  
`make test_ex01`

### Note
Certificates were generated using minica with the following steps:  

1. Installation  
   `go install github.com/jsha/minica@latest`  

2. Generate a root key and cert in minica-key.pem, and minica.pem,
   then generate and sign an end-entity key and cert for server and for client  

   `minica -ip-addresses 127.0.0.1 -domains server`  
   `minica  -domains client`

## Ex02
Added a fun feature to the server's response. Instead of a plain 'thank you,' 
the response includes an ASCII-powered cow generated by the provided C code. 
The server's response now looks like:
```
{"change":0,"thanks":" ____________\n< Thank you! >\n ------------\n        \n       ^__^\n          \n      (oo)\n    _______\n            (__)\n           )\n    /\n    \\\n                ||----w |\n                ||     ||\n"}

```

Run in two different terminal sessions  
`make run_ex02`  
`make test_ex02`
