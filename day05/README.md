## Ex00
Create `areToysBalanced` function to check if the number of toys in the left 
and right subtrees of a binary tree is equal.

## Ex01
Implement `unrollGarland` to traverse a binary tree in a zig-zag pattern and 
return a boolean slice based on the presence of toys.

## Ex02
Design `PresentHeap` using "container/heap" to compare presents by value and 
size. Implement `getNCoolestPresents` to return the top N coolest presents 
from an unsorted slice.

## Ex03
Develop `grabPresents` to solve the Knapsack Problem, selecting presents from 
a slice that fit within a given capacity while maximizing cumulative value.
