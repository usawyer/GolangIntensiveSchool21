## Ex00
This task involves creating an interface called DBReader and implementing two 
classes that adhere to this interface. The implementations, one for reading JSON 
and another for reading XML, should both return objects of the same type. The 
goal is to use the DBReader interface in a Command-Line Interface (CLI) application, 
which reads databases from files.

## Ex01
The CLI application that compares two databases (in JSON and XML formats) for 
modifications. The comparison should identify various modifications, such as added 
or removed cakes, changes in cooking times, addition or removal of ingredients, and 
modifications in unit details. The key aspect is to ensure that the application 
reuses the code and structure established in Exercise 00.

## Ex02
This application extension focuses on managing filesystem backups through a CLI 
tool. The program efficiently compares two plain text files that contain lists 
of file paths. The output of the comparison highlights added and removed files, 
with careful consideration given to memory constraints.
